# auto-dashcam-transporter
Automatically Download Files from your Dashcam

## Inspiration
This Project is heavily inspired by steve192's [Dashcam-Transporter](https://github.com/steve192/dashcam-transporter) Project. 
I made my own version to implement features that are missing for me personally and to make it more customizable. 

# THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.
